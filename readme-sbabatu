CHANGES

The following files were modified/created during the course of the system call
implementation.

1.  getprocsinfo.h - This header file contains the definition of the struct
    containing the two data members pid and pname
2.  defs.h - The struct declaration was added at the top, and the function
    prototype for getprocsinfo function was added.
3.  user.h - The struct declaration and function prototype was added to expose
    the syscall index number to user process
4.  usys.S - getprocinfo macro was added to the list macros
5.  syscall.h - The system call number 22 was assigned to getprocsinfo
6.  sysproc.c - The function call was added to this file.
7.  syscall.c - This file was modified by adding the procsinfo to the list of
    syscalls
8.  proc.c - The system call function was implemented in this file. This is
    where the struc gets populated.
9.  testgetprocsinfo.c - this is the user space testing program that makes the
    system call.

All the modifications made will add little to no overhead to the kernel, because
every block of memory that was dynamically allocated during run time were freed
after the  execution leaves the context.
